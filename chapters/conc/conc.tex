\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{conc}
Proper functioning of the envisioned smart grid relies on the accuracy of data from various measuring devices and meeting the quality of service requirements of grid analytics for timely control and actions.   We proposed methods to improve the accuracy of data obtained from biased sensors in Chapter 2 of this thesis, and in Chapter 3, distributed algorithms are proposed to meet the quality of service requirements of grid applications.

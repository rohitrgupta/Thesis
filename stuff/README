 Request:   
 --------    

 Please drop me a mail (at karkare[AT]iitb.ac.in) if you use the
 iitbthesis.cls provided  here for your  thesis.  I plan  to show
 the usage  statistics to Academic  office to get the  class file
 officially approved by IITB.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------


This directory contains

* README - this file
* iitbthesis.cls - the main class file for IIT Bombay thesis format
                   (version 0.9beta)
                    
* iitblogo.epsi - official IIT Bombay logo

* prelude.tex - example file containing the code to generate title and
                related pages 
* thesis.tex  - example file putting everything together
* FAQ.txt - Some frequently asked questions
* Changes.txt - List of major changes



To use  iitbthesis.cls first time, download  the files iitbthesis.cls,
iitblogo.epsi, prelude.tex  and thesis.tex in the  directory where you
want to write  your thesis.  Modify prelude.tex and  thesis.tex as per
you need. The main class file, iitbthesis.cls, should not be touched.

The class file is still under construction. You can visit this website
regularly to get updated versions of  the file. To update, you have to
download only  iitbthesis.cls, and replace the older  version with the
new one.

I will update the class files  and release these changes as and when I
get requests from users, and get time to do the necessary changes. You
can  send me  a  mail at  "karkare[AT]iitb.ac.in"  to get  information
whenever a new version is released.

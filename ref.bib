Many existing systems for detecting occupant activity require large numbers of sensors, invasive vision systems, or extensive installation procedures. We present an approach that uses a single plug-in sensor to detect a variety of electrical events throughout the home. This sensor detects the electrical noise on residential power lines created by the abrupt switching of electrical devices and the noise created by certain devices while in operation. We use machine learning techniques to recognize electrically noisy events such as turning on or off a particular light switch, a television set, or an electric stove. We tested our system in one home for several weeks and in five homes for one week each to evaluate the system performance over time and in different types of houses. Results indicate that we can learn and classify various electrical events with accuracies ranging from 85-90\%.},

The system learns these constituent current waveforms in an unsupervised fashion and, in a subsequent step, seeks to find combinations of these subcomponents that constitute appliances. By doing so, points in time when appliances are active and, to some degree, their power consumption can be estimated by BOLT. Our system treats energy disaggregation as a binary matrix factorization problem and uses a neural network, with binary activations in the one but last layer and a linear output layer, to solve it. The algorithmic performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a publicly available dataset. Furthermore, we show that, once the model is trained, the algorithm can perform inference in real-time on inexpensive off-the-shelf and general purpose hardware which allows leveraging high-frequency information without having to explicitly transmit and store large amounts of data to a centralized repository.},

Electrical power quantities, harmonic load characteristics, canonical transient and steady-state waveforms are some of the typical choices of load signature or load signature basis for current research addressing appliance classification and prediction. This paper expands and evaluates appliance load signatures based on V-I trajectory-the mutual locus of instantaneous voltage and current waveforms-for precision and robustness of prediction in classification algorithms used to disaggregate residential overall energy use and predict constituent appliance profiles. We also demonstrate the use of variants of differential evolution as a novel strategy for selection of optimal load models in context of energy disaggregation. A publicly available benchmark dataset REDD is employed for evaluation purposes. Our experimental evaluations indicate that these load signatures, in conjunction with a number of popular classification algorithms, offer better or generally comparable overall precision of prediction, robustness and reliability against dynamic, noisy and highly similar load signatures with reference to electrical power quantities and harmonic content. Herein, wave-shape features are found to be an effective new basis of classification and prediction for semi-automated energy disaggregation and monitoring.},

ElectriSense relies on the fact that most modern consumer electronics and fluorescent lighting employ switch mode power supplies (SMPS) to achieve high efficiency. These power supplies continuously generate high frequency electromagnetic interference (EMI) during operation that propagates throughout a home's power wiring. We show both analytically and by in-home experimentation that EMI signals are stable and predictable based on the device's switching frequency characteristics. Unlike past transient noise-based solutions, this new approach provides the ability for EMI signatures to be applicable across homes while still being able to differentiate between similar devices in a home. We have evaluated our solution in seven homes, including one six-month deployment. Our results show that ElectriSense can identify and classify the usage of individual devices with a mean accuracy of 93.82\%.},

  abstract = {The Indian electricity sector, despite having the world's fifth largest installed capacity, suffers from a 12.9\% peaking shortage. This shortage could be alleviated, if a large number of deferrable loads, particularly the high powered ones, could be moved from on-peak to off-peak times. However, conventional DSM strategies may not be suitable for India as the local conditions usually favor only inexpensive solutions with minimal dependence on the pre-existing infrastructure. In this work, we present nPlug, a smart plug that sits between the wall socket and deferrable loads such as water heaters, washing machines, and electric vehicles. nPlugs combine real-time sensing and analytics to infer peak periods as well as supply-demand imbalance and reschedule attached appliances in a decentralized manner to alleviate peaks whenever possible. They do not require any manual intervention by the end consumer nor any enhancements to the appliances or existing infrastructure. Some of nPlug's capabilities are demonstrated using experiments on a combination of synthetic and real data collected from plug-level energy monitors. Our results indicate that nPlug can be an effective and inexpensive technology to address the peaking shortage.},

  abstract = {The thermal storage potential in commercial buildings is an enormous resource for providing various ancillary services to the grid. In this paper, we show how fans in Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems of commercial buildings alone can provide substantial frequency regulation service, with little change in their indoor environments. A feedforward architecture is proposed to control the fan power consumption to track a regulation signal. The proposed control scheme is then tested through simulations based on a calibrated high fidelity non-linear model of a building. Model parameters are identified from data collected in Pugh Hall, a commercial building located on the University of Florida campus. For the HVAC system under consideration, numerical experiments demonstrate how up to 15\% of the rated fan power can be deployed for regulation purpose while having little effect on the building indoor temperature. The regulation signal that can be successfully tracked is constrained in the frequency band [1/{$\tau$}0, 1/{$\tau$}1], where {$\tau$}0 {$\approx$} 3 minutes and {$\tau$}1 {$\approx$} 8 seconds. Our results indicate that fans in existing commercial buildings in the U.S. can provide about 70\% of the current national regulation reserve requirements in the aforementioned frequency band. A unique advantage of the proposed control scheme is that assessing the value of the ancillary service provided is trivial, which is in stark contrast to many demand-response programs.},

These correlations may be leveraged to cluster customers based on common ancestry and help verify and correct an existing connectivity model. Additionally, customers may be clustered in combination with voltage data from circuit metering points, spatial data from the geographical information system, and any existing but partially accurate connectivity model to infer customer to transformer and phase connectivity relationships with high accuracy. We report analysis and validation results based on data collected from multiple feeders of a large electric distribution network in North America.

Real-time end user energy feedback, using disaggregated electric load composition, can play a pivotal role in motivating consumers towards energy conservation. Recent works have explored using high frequency conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) on power lines as a single point sensing parameter for monitoring common home appliances. However, key questions regarding the reliability and feasibility of using EMI signatures for non-intrusive load monitoring over multiple appliances across different sensing paradigms remain unanswered. This work presents some of the key challenges towards using EMI as a unique and time invariant feature for load disaggregation. In-depth empirical evaluations of a large number of appliances in different sensing configurations are carried out, in both laboratory and real world settings. Insights into the effects of external parameters such as line impedance, background noise and appliance coupling on the EMI behavior of an appliance are realized through simulations and measurements. A generic approach for simulating the EMI behavior of an appliance that can then be used to do a detailed analysis of real world phenomenology is presented. The simulation approach is validated with EMI data from a router. Our EMI dataset - High Frequency EMI Dataset (HFED) is also released.},

  abstract = {Conventional AC power meters perform at least two distinct functions: power conversion, to supply the meter itself, and energy metering, to measure the load consumption. This paper presents Monjolo, a new energy-metering architecture that combines these two functions to yield a new design point in the metering space. The key insight underlying this work is that the output of a current transformer -- nominally used to measure a load current -- can be harvested and used to intermittently power a wireless sensor node. The hypothesis is that the node's activation frequency increases monotonically with the primary load's draw, making it possible to estimate load power from the interval between activations, assuming the node consumes a fixed energy quanta during each activation. This paper explores this thesis by designing, implementing, and evaluating the Monjolo metering architecture. The results demonstrate that it is possible to build a meter that draws zero-power under zero-load conditions, offers high accuracy for near-unity power factor loads, works with non-unity power factor loads in combination with a whole-house meter, wirelessly reports readings to a data aggregator, is resilient to communication failures, and is parsimonious with the radio channel, even under heavy loads. Monjolo eliminates the high-voltage AC-DC power supply and AC metering circuitry present in earlier designs, enabling a smaller, simpler, safer, and lower-cost design point that supports novel deployment scenarios like non-intrusive circuit-level metering.},

Therefore, measurement of parameters (such as amplitude and/or phase shift) of electrical systems is of the utmost importance for achieving efficient control on power usage of electric loads in residential and industrial buildings.

We present an innovative low-cost clamp-on power meter, designed and optimized for three-phase systems. It can be installed without temporary interruption of the supply directly on the cable insulators and can measure simultaneously both current and voltage of the underneath wires, providing accurate measurements of apparent power, active power, reactive power and power factor. Moreover an energy harvesting unit extracts the necessary energy to supply the meter without electrical contact, permitting to install the device without need of batteries or power plugs.

  title = {An {{IoT}}-{{Based Smart Utility Meter}}},
  abstract = {Empowered by the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the consumption of electricity, water, and gas by appliances in residential units can be collected more frequently nowadays. However, these meters are still discrete and placed in different locations in apartments or houses. This paper proposes the design, development, and testing of an integrated IoT-based smart utility meter that monitors the consumption of electricity, water, and gas. The meter has a unique network address and can be programmed remotely to read the three utility consumptions at any desired frequency that can be set by the utility service providers. End consumers can access the meter through a personal computer or a mobile handset. Google Map markers are used to the display the status of the meter showing the consumption of each utility and whether the meter is connected or disconnected.},

In the recent years, by the growth of IoT and digital technologies, smart grid has been becoming smarter than before. The future power grid needs to be implemented in a distributed topology that can dynamically absorb different energy sources. IoT can be utilized for various applications of the smart grid including distributed power plant monitoring, power generation and consumption prediction, power consumption monitoring, energy storage monitoring, smart meter, electric vehicle charging, power demand side management and various area of energy production. In this paper, by using the IoT capabilities, we have designed and implemented a smart energy metering platform consisting of smart plugs, gateway and cloud server.},

  title = {Design and {{Implementation}} of {{Power Information Visualization Platform Based}} on {{Smart Meter}}},
  abstract = {User interaction is an important part of the smart grid construction. In order to allow power consumers to have a better understanding of their own household electricity, it is necessary to provide them with real-time electricity information. On the basis of intensive study of the electricity information acquisition system, this paper puts forward a construction scheme of power information visualization platform based on smart meter. The scheme only needs to upgrade and transform the carrier communication module of the smart meter instead of changing the existing electricity information acquisition system. As the modified module increases WiFi communication function, users can establish a communication link with their own smart meter through WiFi. The mobile phone can send a series of instructions which follow the DL/T 645-2007 protocol to call all kinds of power information and data in the smart meter. The platform shows the electricity information to users in a simple and intuitive way. Users can easily check a variety of household power information through the phone app. The platform solves the problem of difficult view of information in the electric meter. It expands application results of the smart meter, meanwhile promotes the friendly communication between the power grid and users.},

The work also aims at proposing a system that will reduce the loss of power and revenue due to Power thefts and other illegal activities. The work system adopts totally new concept called prepaid electricity. The implementation of this will help in better energy management, conservation of energy and also in doing away with the unnecessary hassles over incorrect billing. The automated billing system will help track the real time consumption and will leave little scope for disagreement on consumption and billing.},

We describe two kinds of uses, by visualizing and analyzing smart meter data for an academic building. The first gives us the ability to find anomalous appliance behaviors and the other helps to discover sub-optimal energy consumption patterns. The goal is to stress the fact that the ubiquitous smart meter can act as a sensor not only for monitoring consumption but also for detecting interesting energy usage patterns.},

When a 1 Hz sample of power is used for energy disaggregation it is like taking a low resolution image of an object. The 1 Hz does not capture the complete details of the event that happens at the transition. Sometimes the events are entirely missed out because the averaging will reduce the intensity of the event. Some events are short-lived and are difficult to capture with 1-second samples. Our meter can provide the cycle level power consumption data that can provide better insight into such events. As these signals are sent when the change in power is detected, there is no chance of missing out on these events. Figure \ref{fig:H3Vacuum}, \ref{fig:H6AC}, \ref{fig:H10Microwave}, \ref{fig:H23WashingMachine} shows the comparison of a vacuum cleaner, air conditioner, microwave, and washing machine power data collected at 1 Hz and 50 Hz.

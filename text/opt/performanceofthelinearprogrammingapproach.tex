The linear programming optimization problem is formulated as a graph cover problem with the additional constraint for each sensor. The graph cover problem formulation itself generate a huge number of constraints, therefore, the constraints for the sensor placement problem are even more.  The number of constraints is larger than the number of interactions performed by the brute force algorithm. Out of these constraints, a huge number of constraints are redundant because the same constraint will be derived from the multiple trees generated by the same sensors.  Because of this reason, the model generation for the electrical layout takes exponentially large time and become impossible to manage just after 4 or 5 appliances. Also, the memory requirement for the model exceeds the RAM available on the standard PC.  Because of these reasons the optimization testing is included up to 4 appliances.

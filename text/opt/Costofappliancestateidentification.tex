The baseline case of installing the smart meter for each appliance is generally very high. The cost of the Schneider meters is in the around 9000 Rs, For simplicity we will Ignore the installation cost and the cost of accessories.  If such  a meter is installed for every appliance in an electrical system where 12 appliances are installed, the total cost of installing 12 smart meters will be 108000 Rs. Assuming that the appliances are moderately diverse, the cost of the sensor equipment required when the new low cost smart meter is installed will be 6500 Rs. The new cost is just above  6\% of the baseline cost, which gives us more than 93\% reduction of sensor equipment requirements.

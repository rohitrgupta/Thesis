Current can be sensed to determine the power consumed by an appliance. If the power factor of an appliance is assumed to be constant, the power consumed by it can be given in terms of the current drawn by the appliance as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:currentValue}
i_a \propto P_a \hspace{.5in} \text{ or } \hspace{0.5in} i_a = \frac{y}{x} P_a 
\end{equation}

%$$ i_a \propto P_a \hspace{.5in}
%or \hspace{0.5in}
%i_a = \frac{y}{x} P_a $$
%\noindent

where $\frac{y}{x}$ is such that when appliance is consuming $x$ power it draws $y$ current.

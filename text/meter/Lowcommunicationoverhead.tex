The data collected by the smart meter should be \textbf{communicated efficiently and timely} to the server for processing. Two-way communication is one of the important capabilities of smart energy meters. Retrofitting the required communication capabilities to the existing meters is not always possible and may not provide a cost-effective solution. It may not provide sufficient data samples and can make the infrastructure bulky. It also requires a large number of the messages to be transferred which imposes a restriction on the number of smart meters that can be connected on a single communication channel. Therefore a smart meter should provide intelligent inbuilt communication capabilities.

Although zero crossover detection can be performed in the software, we have provided an analog circuit as shown in figure \ref{fig:triggerCircuit} to perform this task. The zero value for the biased voltage signal could change from circuit to circuit. To adjust to this difference in the voltage level, the crossover reference voltage is generated through a PWM signal generated by the microcontroller. We have observed that the hardware-based zero crossover detection circuit could be useful in increasing the accuracy of voltage and frequency measurement. Zero crossover detection is also useful for accurate measurement of the supply frequency.

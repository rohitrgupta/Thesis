A smart meter should be \textbf{easily upgradeable} both in terms of hardware and software. Current metering infrastructure has lasted for decades but due to consistently changing requirements of the smart grid, the new smart meters may need to be upgraded more frequently. It is impossible to predict the future requirement accurately and design a smart meter that considers all such future requirements. Hence, the new generation of smart meters must be customizable according to the changing needs to avoid design and development cost and to speed up the development process. Once a smart meter is installed, new analytics and value-added services may be introduced based on the new capabilities of such smart meters. In turn, these services will need more sophisticated meters thereby introducing the update cycle. Therefore, to accommodate the ever-changing software and hardware demands, the new smart meters must be modular and support improvement in each module.

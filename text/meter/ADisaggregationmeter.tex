Smart meters should be able to \textbf{disaggregate energy consumption} and estimate appliance health. The research community has been working on disaggregation since Hart \cite{hartNonintrusiveApplianceLoad1992} and developed a large number of techniques to disaggregate energy consumption.  Disaggregation algorithms need a variety of data like the high-frequency current, voltage for sensing EMI noise or combination of both in VI-Trajectory. All such techniques need data at a very high frequency,  Research is mostly done on the data collected by high-end equipment or data collected from industry-grade meters. These equipment are not suitable for mass deployment, therefore, not practical to be used for large scale installation.  Although almost all meters sense and process the high-frequency data, they only provide the low-frequency electrical parameters computed from the high-frequency data. They do not provide the data as desired by the algorithms and do not have much flexibility for querying the data.

Assuming that the power consumed by the appliance is constant and once it is known, only identifying the state of the appliance is sufficient to compute the total power consumed by the appliance during a period.

All electric appliances are to perform some tasks which in turn causes some physical change in the surroundings. These are all observable changes like light, heat, motion, etc. Which is the expected work of the appliance? There could also be some unintended side effects which also affect the surrounding like noise caused by the fan, vibration caused by the compressor of the refrigerator.

Lighting appliance produces enough light to identify it states. Cheap light intensity sensors are available which can be used to identify the lighting appliance state but the accurate placement of such a sensor is very critical because these sensors can easily be misled by daylight or light from nearby lighting equipment.

A sensor like an infrared emitter pair could be used to detect if a fan is moving out stationary or even to measure the speed of the fan. These sensors are impacted by other infrared light sources like the daylight but can be compensated for such different environment. A skilled worker is required to install such a sensor as these sensors should be placed accurately and may be required to calibrated during installation.

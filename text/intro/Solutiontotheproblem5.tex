\textbf{To identify the location where sensors should be install}

Electrical distribution systems supply power to a large number of appliances installed in any building. The number of appliances can very easily go beyond tens in any household and hundreds in any commercial building. Various sensing options are suggested identifying the state of the appliance and the power consumption of appliances. But these approaches face limitations because of the training required to learn the signature of these appliances. There are only a limited number of sensors like smart meters that do not require learning a signature. 

Many of these appliances are identical and difficult to differentiate based on their power consumption pattern. In such a case it becomes difficult to identify a single sensing parameter that can distinguish between these appliances. 

We present the optimization formulation for the sensor placement problem and prove that it is an np-hard problem. We also present a greedy algorithm that provides a reasonable number of the sensor required for any setup.

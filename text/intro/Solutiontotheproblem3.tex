\textbf{To design a sensor data collection system that can reliably collect data from multiple sensors}

Collecting data from a large number of sensors without interruption and errors is a difficult task. There are many weak points where the data collection system may breakdown. Communication may get interruption, the device may not get continuous power supply or the IoT device may fail with time. For such problems, the system should be capable of recovering itself and 

The person installing the equipment install the equipment to correctly three-phase or may tag the sensor wrongly. With three-phase systems, the probability of putting the wrong phase number on the meter is very high because the person installing the meter may not receive correct information or may not receive the information at all. In such a scenario an IoT installation mechanism is required which can enable any person who is not an expert in the system and can install them without need to perform any technical task. The gateway IoT device should automatically detect the topology of the network connecting these devices and should also adapt to the changes to such topology without any intervention.

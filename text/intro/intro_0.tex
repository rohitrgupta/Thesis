\section{Overview}
The reliability of the next-generation smart grid requires \emph{accurate data} delivered to grid applications--within their \emph{latency requirements}.  In this thesis, we discuss the challenges in meeting the data accuracy and latency requirements of grid applications and propose algorithmic solutions to address them. We begin with a brief background of an electric grid along with the technologies used for sensing, communicating, and processing of various parameters in the future smart grid.
